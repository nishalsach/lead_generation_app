2201.04292v2,0.6810475591331007,Predicting Terrorist Attacks in the United States using Localized News Data,"Terrorism is a major problem worldwide, causing thousands of fatalities and billions of dollars in damage every year. Toward the end of better understanding and mitigating these attacks, we present a set of machine learning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether a terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state. The best model--a Random Forest that learns from a novel variable-length moving average representation of the feature space--achieves area under the receiver operating characteristic scores $> .667$ on four of the five states that were impacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. Our key findings include that modeling terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous process, is a fruitful approach--especially when the events are sparse and dissimilar. Additionally, our results highlight the need for localized models that account for differences between locations. From a machine learning perspective, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed several deep models on our multimodal, noisy, and imbalanced data set, thus demonstrating the efficacy of our novel feature representation method in such a context. We also show that its predictions are relatively robust to time gaps between attacks and observed characteristics of the attacks. Finally, we analyze factors that limit model performance, which include a noisy feature space and small amount of available data. These contributions provide an important foundation for the use of machine learning in efforts against terrorism in the United States and beyond."," Terrorism: Localized News Data May Help Predict Attacks, Says Study",Can Localized News Data Really Help Predict Terrorist Attacks?,Study Shows That Machine Learning Can Improve Prediction of Terrorist Attacks in the United States,0.34416021781415546,0.3068780911583814,0.3112029398050133,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04292v2,cs.lg,['cs.lg'],2022-01-11,1,0.92
2201.04796v1,0.44240474508266076,CFNet: Learning Correlation Functions for One-Stage Panoptic Segmentation,"Recently, there is growing attention on one-stage panoptic segmentation methods which aim to segment instances and stuff jointly within a fully convolutional pipeline efficiently. However, most of the existing works directly feed the backbone features to various segmentation heads ignoring the demands for semantic and instance segmentation are different: The former needs semantic-level discriminative features, while the latter requires features to be distinguishable across instances. To alleviate this, we propose to first predict semantic-level and instance-level correlations among different locations that are utilized to enhance the backbone features, and then feed the improved discriminative features into the corresponding segmentation heads, respectively. Specifically, we organize the correlations between a given location and all locations as a continuous sequence and predict it as a whole. Considering that such a sequence can be extremely complicated, we adopt Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a tool that can approximate an arbitrary sequence parameterized by amplitudes and phrases. For different tasks, we generate these parameters from the backbone features in a fully convolutional way which is optimized implicitly by corresponding tasks. As a result, these accurate and consistent correlations contribute to producing plausible discriminative features which meet the requirements of the complicated panoptic segmentation task. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct experiments on several challenging panoptic segmentation datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MS COCO with $45.1$\% PQ and ADE20k with $32.6$\% PQ.",CFNet: A new method for panoptic segmentation,CFNet: Learning Correlation Functions for improved one-stage panoptic segmentation,FNet: Discrete Fourier Transform used to approximate complex sequence for panoptic segmentation,0.19283033577084185,0.18436619745292152,0.15332436992619508,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04796v1,cs.cv,['cs.cv'],2022-01-12,0,0.79

Considering that most scenarios have few intents known already and most intents waiting to be discovered, we focus on semi-supervised text clustering and try to make the proposed method benefit from labeled samples for better overall clustering performance. In this paper, we propose Deep Contrastive Semi-supervised Clustering (DCSC), which aims to cluster text samples in a semi-supervised way and provide grouped intents to operation staff. To make DCSC fully utilize the limited known intents, we propose a two-stage training procedure for DCSC, in which DCSC will be trained on both labeled samples and unlabeled samples, and achieve better text representation and clustering performance.

Researchers found that agents' lack of environmental knowledge, the difficulty of orienting users in their surroundings, and the inability to estimate distances from users' camera feeds are key challenges to sighted agents. To address these challenges, researchers have suggested assisting agents with computer vision technologies, especially 3D reconstruction. This paper presents a high-fidelity prototype of such an RSA, where agents use interactive 3D maps with localization capability. We conducted a walkthrough study with thirteen agents and one user with simulated vision impairment using this prototype. The study revealed that, compared to baseline RSA, the agents were significantly faster in providing navigational assistance to users, and their mental workload was significantly reduced -- all indicate the feasibility and prospect of 3D maps in RSA.",Interactive 3D Map Helps Remote Sighted Agents Provide Better Assistance to Those With Vision Impairments,Study Shows That 3D Maps Significantly Reduce Mental Workload for Remote Sighted Agents,3D Maps May Be the Key to Better Remote Sighted Assistance for Those With Vision Impairments,0.28642262817753733,0.32578975263885357,0.27273641389035685,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01365v1,cs.hc,['cs.hc'],2022-02-02,0,0.86
2202.02278v1,0.5011711681251875,LTU Attacker for Membership Inference,"We address the problem of defending predictive models, such as machine learning classifiers (Defender models), against membership inference attacks, in both the black-box and white-box setting, when the trainer and the trained model are publicly released. The Defender aims at optimizing a dual objective: utility and privacy. Both utility and privacy are evaluated with an external apparatus including an Attacker and an Evaluator. On one hand, Reserved data, distributed similarly to the Defender training data, is used to evaluate Utility; on the other hand, Reserved data, mixed with Defender training data, is used to evaluate membership inference attack robustness. In both cases classification accuracy or error rate are used as the metric: Utility is evaluated with the classification accuracy of the Defender model; Privacy is evaluated with the membership prediction error of a so-called ""Leave-Two-Unlabeled"" LTU Attacker, having access to all of the Defender and Reserved data, except for the membership label of one sample from each. We prove that, under certain conditions, even a ""na\""ive"" LTU Attacker can achieve lower bounds on privacy loss with simple attack strategies, leading to concrete necessary conditions to protect privacy, including: preventing over-fitting and adding some amount of randomness. However, we also show that such a na\""ive LTU Attacker can fail to attack the privacy of models known to be vulnerable in the literature, demonstrating that knowledge must be complemented with strong attack strategies to turn the LTU Attacker into a powerful means of evaluating privacy. Our experiments on the QMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets validate our theoretical results and confirm the roles of over-fitting prevention and randomness in the algorithms to protect against privacy attacks.","na\""ive"" LTU Attacker can achieve lower bounds on privacy loss with simple attack strategies","na\""ive"" LTU Attacker can fail to attack the privacy of models known to be vulnerable in the literature",over-fitting prevention and randomness in the algorithms to protect against privacy attacks,0.2910279871441884,0.26794262627925425,0.23574502850433005,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02278v1,cs.lg,['cs.lg'],2022-02-04,1,0.87

Recent theoretical developments in bilevel optimization focus on finding the first-order stationary points for nonconvex-strongly-convex cases. In this paper, we analyze algorithms that can escape saddle points in nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Specifically, we show that the perturbed approximate implicit differentiation (AID) with a warm start strategy finds $\epsilon$-approximate local minimum of bilevel optimization in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations with high probability.

This study aims to understand the behavior of academic job transition and hence recommend suitable institutions for PhD graduates. Specifically, we design a deep learning model to predict the career move of early-career researchers and provide suggestions. The design is built on top of scholarly/academic networks, which contains abundant information about scientific collaboration among scholars and institutions. We construct a heterogeneous scholarly network to facilitate the exploring of the behavior of career moves and the recommendation of institutions for scholars. We devise an unsupervised learning model called HAI (Heterogeneous graph Attention InfoMax) which aggregates attention mechanism and mutual information for institution recommendation. Moreover, we propose scholar attention and meta-path attention to discover the hidden relationships between several meta-paths. With these mechanisms, HAI provides ordered recommendations with explainability. We evaluate HAI upon a real-world dataset against baseline methods.

It is impractical in some applications, however, due to data privacy issues or constraints in compression time budget. To deal with the above issues, we propose a method named PRACTISE to accelerate the network with tiny sets of training images. By considering both the pruned part and the unpruned part of a compressed model, PRACTISE alleviates layer-wise error accumulation, which is the main drawback of previous methods. Furthermore, existing methods are confined to few compression schemes, have limited speedup in terms of latency, and are unstable. In contrast, PRACTISE is stable, fast to train, versatile to handle various compression schemes, and achieves low latency. We also propose that dropping entire blocks is a better way than existing compression schemes when only tiny sets of training data are available.

2202.10560v1,0.35713178786079264,Moment Matching Deep Contrastive Latent Variable Models,"In the contrastive analysis (CA) setting, machine learning practitioners are specifically interested in discovering patterns that are enriched in a target dataset as compared to a background dataset generated from sources of variation irrelevant to the task at hand. For example, a biomedical data analyst may seek to understand variations in genomic data only present among patients with a given disease as opposed to those also present in healthy control subjects. Such scenarios have motivated the development of contrastive latent variable models to isolate variations unique to these target datasets from those shared across the target and background datasets, with current state of the art models based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. However, previously proposed models do not explicitly enforce the constraints on latent variables underlying CA, potentially leading to the undesirable leakage of information between the two sets of latent variables. Here we propose the moment matching contrastive VAE (MM-cVAE), a reformulation of the VAE for CA that uses the maximum mean discrepancy to explicitly enforce two crucial latent variable constraints underlying CA. On three challenging CA tasks we find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art both qualitatively and on a set of quantitative metrics.",Machine learning practitioners develop new contrastive latent variable models to isolate variations unique to target datasets.,"The new model, MM-cVAE, outperforms previous state-of-the-art models both qualitatively and quantitatively.",MM-cVAE uses the maximum mean discrepancy to explicitly enforce two crucial latent variable constraints underlying CA.,0.19672266174531494,0.17810098292092263,0.12303923807242038,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10560v1,cs.lg,['cs.lg'],2022-02-21,1,0.8

Compared to the general problem of human pose estimation, in-bed pose estimation has several inherent challenges, the most prominent being frequent and severe occlusions caused by bedding. In this paper we explore the effective use of images from multiple non-visual and privacy-preserving modalities such as depth, long-wave infrared (LWIR) and pressure maps for the task of in-bed pose estimation in two settings. First, we explore the effective fusion of information from different imaging modalities for better pose estimation. Secondly, we propose a framework that can estimate in-bed pose estimation when visible images are unavailable, and demonstrate the applicability of fusion methods to scenarios where only LWIR images are available. We analyze and demonstrate the effect of fusing features from multiple modalities. For this purpose, we consider four different techniques: 1) Addition, 2) Concatenation, 3) Fusion via learned modal weights, and 4) End-to-end fully trainable approach; with a state-of-the-art pose estimation model. We also evaluate the effect of reconstructing a data-rich modality (i.e., visible modality) from a privacy-preserving modality with data scarcity (i.e., long-wavelength infrared) for in-bed human pose estimation. For reconstruction, we use a conditional generative adversarial network. We conduct ablative studies across different design decisions of our framework. This includes selecting features with different levels of granularity, using different fusion techniques, and varying model parameters.

Based on the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference formalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience perspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic, temporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free energy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with obstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well in procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of obstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations. To improve and focus model learning further, we plan to invoke active inference-based, information-gain-oriented behavior also while learning the temporally predictive model itself in the near future.

The developed TF-Grasp framework has two elaborate designs making it well suitable for visual grasping tasks. The first key design is that we adopt the local window attention to capture local contextual information and detailed features of graspable objects. Then, we apply the cross window attention to model the long-term dependencies between distant pixels. Object knowledge, environmental configuration, and relationships between different visual entities are aggregated for subsequent grasp detection. The second key design is that we build a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections, delivering shallow features from encoder to decoder to enable a multi-scale feature fusion. Due to the powerful attention mechanism, the TF-Grasp can simultaneously obtain the local information (i.e., the contours of objects), and model long-term connections such as the relationships between distinct visual concepts in clutter. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the TF-Grasp achieves superior results versus state-of-art grasping convolutional models and attain a higher accuracy of 97.99% and 94.6% on Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets, respectively.

In the model, each document is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics and each topic is modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. Furthermore, each topic probability is modeled as a finite mixture over side data.

The interaction module converts click-based interactions into an object mask, which is then inferred to the remaining frames by the propagation module. Additional user interactions allow for a refinement of the object mask.

Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture, which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words in the front positions are always illusoryly considered more important since they appear in more prefixes, resulting in position bias, which makes the model pay more attention on the front source positions in testing. In this paper, we first analyze the phenomenon of position bias in SiMT, and develop a Length-Aware Framework to reduce the position bias by bridging the structural gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT. Specifically, given the streaming inputs, we first predict the full-sentence length and then fill the future source position with positional encoding, thereby turning the streaming inputs into a pseudo full-sentence. The proposed framework can be integrated into most existing SiMT methods to further improve performance.

In this paper, we first identify and examine obstacles and pain points one can experience when offloading server-based computations to the network. Then we present P4RROT, a code generator (in form of a library) which allows to overcome these limitations by providing a user-friendly API to describe computations to be offloaded. After discussing the design choices behind P4RROT, we introduce our proof-of-concept implementation for two P4 targets: Netronome SmartNIC and BMv2.",P4RROT: Generating P4 Code for the Application Layer,Overcoming Obstacles to Offload Server-Based Computations to Network Switches,Introducing P4RROT: A Code Generator for P4,0.22276125983393735,0.2897508561220242,0.2093957350010952,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02739v1,cs.ni,['cs.ni'],2022-04-06,1,0.83

The proposed method incorporates four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask makes use of abundant text training data. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Our contribution lies in integrating linguistic information from the text corpus into the speech pre-training. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. Two pre-training configurations for speech translation and recognition, respectively, are presented to alleviate subtask interference. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model.

In this work, we propose to answer this question by interpreting the adaptation behavior using post-hoc explanations from model predictions. By modeling feature statistics of explanations, we discover that (1) without fine-tuning, pre-trained models (e.g. BERT and RoBERTa) show strong prediction bias across labels; (2) although few-shot fine-tuning can mitigate the prediction bias and demonstrate promising prediction performance, our analysis shows models gain performance improvement by capturing non-task-related features (e.g. stop words) or shallow data patterns (e.g. lexical overlaps).

Though many point cloud completion methods have been proposed, most of them require a large number of paired complete-incomplete point clouds for training, which is labor exhausted. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel Reconstruction-Aware Prior Distillation semi-supervised point cloud completion method named RaPD, which takes advantage of a two-stage training scheme to reduce the dependence on a large-scale paired dataset. In training stage 1, the so-called deep semantic prior is learned from both unpaired complete and unpaired incomplete point clouds using a reconstruction-aware pretraining process. While in training stage 2, we introduce a semi-supervised prior distillation process, where an encoder-decoder-based completion network is trained by distilling the prior into the network utilizing only a small number of paired training samples. A self-supervised completion module is further introduced, excavating the value of a large number of unpaired incomplete point clouds, leading to an increase in the network's performance.

In this work, we aim at investigating the relationship between the number of coordinated views and users analytic processes and results. To achieve the goal, we implemented a CMV tool for visual anlaysis.

The plug & play nature lies in the fact that the manual teaching and configuration of robots is not required. A digital twin (DT) based concept is proposed that outlines the types of information that has to be provided for each relevant component of the system. In particular, for the devices that the robot interfaces with, the robot positions have to be defined beforehand in a device-attached coordinate system (CS) by the vendor. This CS has to be detectable by the vision system of the robot by means of optical markers placed on the front side of the device. With that, the robot is capable of tending the machine by performing the pick-and-place type transportation of standard sample carriers. This basic use case is the primary scope of the LAPP-DT framework. The hardware scope is limited to simple benchtop and mobile manipulators with parallel grippers at this stage. This paper first provides an overview of relevant literature and state-of-the-art solutions, after which it outlines the framework on the conceptual level, followed by the specification of the relevant DT parameters for the robot, for the devices and for the facility.

However, caused by severe domain gaps (e.g., the field of view (FOV), pixel size, and object size among datasets), Mono3D detectors have difficulty in generalization, leading to drastic performance degradation on unseen domains. To solve these issues, we combine the position-invariant transform and multi-scale training with the pixel-size depth strategy to construct an effective unified camera-generalized paradigm (CGP). It fully considers discrepancies in the FOV and pixel size of images captured by different cameras. Moreover, we further investigate the obstacle in quantitative metrics when cross-dataset inference through an exhaustive systematic study. We discern that the size bias of prediction leads to a colossal failure. Hence, we propose the 2D-3D geometry-consistent object scaling strategy (GCOS) to bridge the gap via an instance-level augment.

Alongside the awareness of the benefits brought by AI, there is a growing consensus on the necessity of tackling the risks and potential harms, such as bias and discrimination, brought about by advanced AI technologies. A multitude of AI ethics principles have been proposed to tackle these risks, but the outlines of organizational processes and practices for ensuring socially responsible AI development are in a nascent state. To address the paucity of comprehensive governance models, we present an AI governance framework, the hourglass model of organizational AI governance, which targets organizations that develop and use AI systems. The framework is designed to help organizations deploying AI systems translate ethical AI principles into practice and align their AI systems and processes with the forthcoming European AI Act. The hourglass framework includes governance requirements at the environmental, organizational, and AI system levels. At the AI system level, we connect governance requirements to AI system life cycles to ensure governance throughout the system's life span. The governance model highlights the systemic nature of AI governance and opens new research avenues into its practical implementation, the mechanisms that connect different AI governance layers, and the dynamics between the AI governance actors.

While such models are highly flexible, they struggle to understand the composition of certain concepts, such as confusing the attributes of different objects or relations between objects. In this paper, we propose an alternative structured approach for compositional generation using diffusion models. An image is generated by composing a set of diffusion models, with each of them modeling a certain component of the image. To do this, we interpret diffusion models as energy-based models in which the data distributions defined by the energy functions may be explicitly combined. The proposed method can generate scenes at test time that are substantially more complex than those seen in training, composing sentence descriptions, object relations, human facial attributes, and even generalizing to new combinations that are rarely seen in the real world. We further illustrate how our approach may be used to compose pre-trained text-guided diffusion models and generate photorealistic images containing all the details described in the input descriptions, including the binding of certain object attributes that have been shown difficult for DALLE-2. These results point to the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting structured generalization for visual generation.

We posit the detection of conversation groups as a learning problem that could benefit from leveraging the spatial context of the surroundings, and the inherent temporal context in interpersonal dynamics which is reflected in the temporal dynamics in human behavior signals, an aspect that has not been addressed in recent prior works. This motivates our approach which consists of a dynamic LSTM-based deep learning model that predicts continuous pairwise affinity values indicating how likely two people are in the same conversation group. These affinity values are also continuous in time, since relationships and group membership do not occur instantaneously, even though the ground truths of group membership are binary. Using the predicted affinity values, we apply a graph clustering method based on Dominant Set extraction to identify the conversation groups. We benchmark the proposed method against established methods on multiple social interaction datasets. Our results showed that the proposed method improves group detection performance in data that has more temporal granularity in conversation group labels. Additionally, we provide an analysis in the predicted affinity values in relation to the conversation group detection.

To this end, regularization techniques like image augmentation are necessary for deep neural networks to generalize well. Nevertheless, most prevalent image augmentation recipes confine themselves to off-the-shelf linear transformations like scale, flip, and colorjitter. Due to their hand-crafted property, these augmentations are insufficient to generate truly hard augmented examples. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of augmentation to regularize the training process. Inspired by the recent success of applying masked image modeling to self-supervised learning, we adopt the self-supervised masked autoencoder to generate the distorted view of the input images. We show that utilizing such model-based nonlinear transformation as data augmentation can improve high-level recognition tasks.

However, it is difficult to control the pre-trained language models to generate sentences with the desired attribute such as topic and sentiment, etc. Recently, Bayesian Controllable Language Models (BCLMs) have been shown to be efficient in controllable language generation. Rather than fine-tuning the parameters of pre-trained language models, BCLMs use external discriminators to guide the generation of pre-trained language models. However, the mismatch between training and inference of BCLMs limits the performance of the models. To address the problem, in this work we propose a ""Gemini Discriminator"" for controllable language generation which alleviates the mismatch problem with a small computational cost.

Due to the ever-growing model size, the standard full fine-tuning based task adaptation strategy becomes prohibitively costly in terms of model training and storage. This has led to a new research direction in parameter-efficient transfer learning. However, existing attempts typically focus on downstream tasks from the same modality (e.g., image understanding) of the pre-trained model. This creates a limit because in some specific modalities, (e.g., video understanding) such a strong pre-trained model with sufficient knowledge is less or not available. In this work, we investigate such a novel cross-modality transfer learning setting, namely parameter-efficient image-to-video transfer learning. To solve this problem, we propose a new Spatio-Temporal Adapter (ST-Adapter) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning per video task. With a built-in spatio-temporal reasoning capability in a compact design, ST-Adapter enables a pre-trained image model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a small (~8%) per-task parameter cost, requiring approximately 20 times fewer updated parameters compared to previous work.

Recently, transformers have shown their strong capability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and this capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying transformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two reasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to irregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from the non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way interactions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs from existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the non-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches. This is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation that can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the non-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and Video Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",A new transformer for shadow removal promises better results than current methods.,The CRFormer overcomes several challenges facing other transformers for shadow removal.,Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the CRFormer for shadow removal.,0.15484312204334655,0.14398908076604455,0.12148690177741553,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01600v1,cs.cv,['cs.cv'],2022-07-04,0,0.88

In this paper, we introduce a novel initiative advisor-in-the-loop actor-critic framework, termed as Ask-AC, that replaces the unilateral advisor-guidance mechanism with a bidirectional learner-initiative one, and thereby enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between learner and advisor. At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components, namely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both stationary and non-stationary environments and across different actor-critic backbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.","New Initiative Advisor-in-the-Loop Actor-Critic Framework, termed as Ask-AC, enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between learner and advisor.","At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components, namely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures.","The proposed framework significantly improves the learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.",0.2883061189766604,0.26409798453737565,0.20464770544002908,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01955v1,cs.lg,"['cs.lg', 'cs.ai']",2022-07-05,1,0.86

We improve the offline training procedure of popular fully-convolutional Siamese approaches by augmenting their losses with a binary segmentation task. Once the offline training is completed, SiamMask only requires a single bounding box for initialization and can simultaneously carry out visual object tracking and segmentation at high frame-rates. Moreover, we show that it is possible to extend the framework to handle multiple object tracking and segmentation by simply re-using the multi-task model in a cascaded fashion. Experimental results show that our approach has high processing efficiency, at around 55 frames per second. It yields real-time state-of-the-art results on visual-object tracking benchmarks, while at the same time demonstrating competitive performance at a high speed for video object segmentation benchmarks.",SiamMask: A Framework for Fast Online Object Tracking and Segmentation.,SiamMask improves the offline training procedure of popular fully-convolutional Siamese approaches by augmenting their losses with a binary segmentation task.,SiamMask only requires a single bounding box for initialization and can simultaneously carry out visual object tracking and segmentation at high frame-rates.,0.18330257408626355,0.17582952270424632,0.14292112571829296,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02088v1,cs.cv,['cs.cv'],2022-07-05,0,0.82

This paper explores the idea of leveraging hybrid modes to meet multiple operating points with a lightweight and efficient system by using hydraulic valves to dynamically reconfigure the connections of a hydrostatic actuator. The analyzed opportunities consist in 1) switching between a highly geared power source or a fast power source, 2) dynamically connecting an energy accumulator and 3) using a locking mechanism for holding. Based on a knee exoskeleton case study analysis, results show that switching between gearing ratio can lead to a lighter and more efficient actuator. Also, results show that using an accumulator to provide a preload continuous force has great mass-saving potential, but does not reduce mass significantly if used as a power booster for short transients. Finally, using a locking valve can slightly reduce battery mass if the work cycle includes frequent stops. The operating principles of the proposed multimodal schemes are demonstrated with a one-DOF prototype.","Robots are about to get a lot more wearable, thanks to new actuator technology","Scientists develop 'multimodal' actuators for efficient, lightweight wearable robots",Wearable robot actuators just got a whole lot better - here's why,0.16967137269236848,0.1464669675812577,0.16751340396841055,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02619v1,cs.ro,['cs.ro'],2022-07-06,0,0.83
2207.04306v1,0.49039460869478213,Out-of-Distribution Detection in Time-Series Domain: A Novel Seasonal Ratio Scoring Approach,"Safe deployment of time-series classifiers for real-world applications relies on the ability to detect the data which is not generated from the same distribution as training data. This task is referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We consider the novel problem of OOD detection for the time-series domain. We discuss the unique challenges posed by time-series data and explain why prior methods from the image domain will perform poorly. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel {\em Seasonal Ratio Scoring (SRS)} approach. SRS consists of three key algorithmic steps. First, each input is decomposed into class-wise semantic component and remainder. Second, this decomposition is employed to estimate the class-wise conditional likelihoods of the input and remainder using deep generative models. The seasonal ratio score is computed from these estimates. Third, a threshold interval is identified from the in-distribution data to detect OOD examples. Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the SRS method is well-suited for time-series OOD detection when compared to baseline methods.

Due to the nature of regulated medical device software and the difficulty in acquiring large amounts of labeled medical datasets, we consider the task of predicting the test accuracy of an arbitrary black-box model on an unlabeled target domain without modification to the original training process or any distributional assumptions of the original source data (i.e. we treat the model as a ""black-box"" and only use the predicted output responses). We propose a ""black-box"" test estimation technique based on conformal prediction and evaluate it against other methods on three medical imaging datasets (mammography, dermatology, and histopathology) under several clinically relevant types of distribution shift (institution, hardware scanner, atlas, hospital). We hope that by promoting practical and effective estimation techniques for black-box models, manufacturers of medical devices will develop more standardized and realistic evaluation procedures to improve the robustness and trustworthiness of clinical AI tools.",Estimating Test Performance of AI Medical Devices,Estimating the Test Performance of Software AI-based Medical Devices,Estimating the Test Performance of AI Medical Devices under Distribution Shift,0.307072794902049,0.28201824949334675,0.22233625374017219,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05796v1,cs.lg,['cs.lg'],2022-07-12,0,0.85
2207.07826v1,0.4220329866924762,Cross-Domain Cross-Set Few-Shot Learning via Learning Compact and Aligned Representations,"Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel queries with only a few support samples through leveraging prior knowledge from a base dataset. In this paper, we consider the domain shift problem in FSL and aim to address the domain gap between the support set and the query set. Different from previous cross-domain FSL work (CD-FSL) that considers the domain shift between base and novel classes, the new problem, termed cross-domain cross-set FSL (CDSC-FSL), requires few-shot learners not only to adapt to the new domain, but also to be consistent between different domains within each novel class. To this end, we propose a novel approach, namely stabPA, to learn prototypical compact and cross-domain aligned representations, so that the domain shift and few-shot learning can be addressed simultaneously. We evaluate our approach on two new CDCS-FSL benchmarks built from the DomainNet and Office-Home datasets respectively. Remarkably, our approach outperforms multiple elaborated baselines by a large margin, e.g., improving 5-shot accuracy by 6.0 points on average on DomainNet.

2207.07922v1,0.41858939322002753,Learning Quality-aware Dynamic Memory for Video Object Segmentation,"Recently, several spatial-temporal memory-based methods have verified that storing intermediate frames and their masks as memory are helpful to segment target objects in videos. However, they mainly focus on better matching between the current frame and the memory frames without explicitly paying attention to the quality of the memory. Therefore, frames with poor segmentation masks are prone to be memorized, which leads to a segmentation mask error accumulation problem and further affect the segmentation performance. In addition, the linear increase of memory frames with the growth of frame number also limits the ability of the models to handle long videos. To this end, we propose a Quality-aware Dynamic Memory Network (QDMN) to evaluate the segmentation quality of each frame, allowing the memory bank to selectively store accurately segmented frames to prevent the error accumulation problem. Then, we combine the segmentation quality with temporal consistency to dynamically update the memory bank to improve the practicability of the models. Without any bells and whistles, our QDMN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Quality Assessment Module (QAM) can be applied to memory-based methods as generic plugins and significantly improves performance.
